in essence, we have a dataframe in csv format that shows us the list 
of the files we are going to download. 
so in essence, download all files and this will show 
us when the file was downloaded. then use this to sort the directory
of files to match the dataframe we used that shows us what filings to grab
and now iterate through each row of df, grab unique data, 
and use this data to rename the file
